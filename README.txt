tbh lads the Lithuania drawing doesn't remotely match the artstyle of the oter art that's been proposed / is being used, so it seems reasonable to say that we should use a differrent Lithuania girl

Also, so that we can co-ordinate on this shit, we should be able to contact each other
For this, I have created a steam group (http://steamcommunity.com/groups/baltausnz)
A skype group would probably be a good idea too, but obviously not everyone uses skype
